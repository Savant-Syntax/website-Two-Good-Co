**30th Oct, 2024** <br><br>

Today I started this project.<br>
This project is to make a clone of the website named "Two Good Co".<br><br>

What I have done now?<br>
First I added the essential files to this project like Html, Css, and JavaScript.<br>
I'm using the gsap library of javascript to create this project.<br>
I'm using the font **Futura** which is not available on google fonts so I had to download to it front its main website.<br>

What problems I'm facing right now?<br>
A div with id play doesn't show up in the website. Only when I inspect then it pops up.<br>
